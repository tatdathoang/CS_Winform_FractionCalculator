# CS_Winform_FractionCalculator

This is an simple project I built to help people on learning how to do math with fraction and compare fractions.
It has three modes:
- Study: teach people on how to calculate/compare fraction
- Autobot: A fraction calculator
- Test: auto generate fraction for user to test thier skill on calculate/compare fraction
An executable of this prject is available in this repository as well. (Try it, it has cool visual effects!)
